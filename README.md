   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Set up the necessary API keys or access permissions for the cryptocurrency data sources.

2. Run the data extraction scripts to collect cryptocurrency data.

3. Preprocess the extracted data using the provided preprocessing scripts.

4. Train the transformer model using the preprocessed data.

5. Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions on cryptocurrency trends.

## Data Extraction

The data extraction process involves gathering cryptocurrency data from various sources, including websites and APIs. Web scraping techniques may be employed to extract data from websites, while APIs provide structured access to cryptocurrency data.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing stage involves cleaning and transforming the extracted cryptocurrency data to make it suitable for model training. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and detecting outliers.

## Model Training

The model training phase utilizes a transformer-based neural network architecture implemented using PyTorch. The model is trained on the preprocessed cryptocurrency data to learn patterns and trends for analysis and forecasting.
